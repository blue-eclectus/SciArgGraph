- content: SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily by the airborne route.
  id: C1
  type: Conclusion
- content: The transmission patterns observed in superspreading events are inconsistent with droplet or fomite transmission and instead indicate aerosol transmission as the dominant mode.
  id: SC1
  type: Proposition
- content: Superspreading events account for substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission
  id: S1
  source: reference 6
  textual_basis:
    text: superspreading events account for substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission
  type: Datum
- content: Detailed analyses of superspreading events have found patterns of long-range transmission
    and overdispersion of R0
  id: S2
  source: reference 6
  textual_basis:
    text: Detailed analyses of human behaviours and interactions, room sizes, ventilation,
      and other variables in choir concerts, cruise ships, slaughterhouses, care homes,
      and correctional facilities, among other settings, have shown patterns—eg, long-range
      transmission and overdispersion of the basic reproduction number (R0)
  type: Datum
- content: The observed patterns of long-range transmission and overdispersion are
    consistent with airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 and cannot be adequately explained
    by droplets or fomites
  id: S3
  type: Proposition
- content: SARS-CoV-2 can spread between individuals who are physically separated
    and have no direct contact.
  id: SC2
  type: Proposition
- content: Long-range transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between people in adjacent rooms has been documented in quarantine hotels
  id: S4
  source: quarantine hotel documentation
  textual_basis:
    text: long-range transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between people in adjacent rooms but
      never in each other's presence has been documented in quarantine hotels
  type: Datum
- content: Transmission occurs through aerosols generated during
    normal speech and breathing, even in the absence of coughing or sneezing.
  id: SC3
  type: Proposition
- content: 33-59% of all transmission comes from non-coughing/sneezing individuals.
  id: S5
  source: reference 8
  textual_basis:
    text: asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from people who
      are not coughing or sneezing is likely to account for at least a third, and
      perhaps up to 59%, of all transmission globally
  type: Datum
- content: Speaking produces thousands of aerosol particles and few large droplets
  id: S6
  source: reference 9
  textual_basis:
    text: Direct measurements show that speaking produces thousands of aerosol particles
      and few large droplets
  type: Datum
- content: Transmission without coughing/sneezing rules out droplets as sole mechanism of spread.
  explicitness: inferred
  id: P_7b77a94b
  type: Proposition
- content: Aerosol particles generated during speech can carry and transmit SARS-CoV-2
    virus to susceptible individuals through inhalation.
  explicitness: inferred
  id: P_176d8424
  type: Proposition
- content: Coughing and sneezing are the primary mechanisms for generating large respiratory
    droplets.
  explicitness: inferred
  auxiliary: true
  id: P_7b77a94b_SC3_aux1
  type: Proposition
- content: Aerosol particles are small enough to remain suspended in air and be inhaled
    into the respiratory tract.
